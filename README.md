# Classifying-Penguins-with-Machine-Learning

In this project, the goal is to classify penguin species using various classification algorithms. The dataset contains information about penguins from three different species: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo. 
The data provides various features of the penguins, which will be used to train and evaluate classification models.
